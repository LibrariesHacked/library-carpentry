Task
----

To understand more about why Git and GitHub can be useful we're going to discuss how we all currently store documents and data.  Particularly where we require collaboration on those documents, including seeing when changes have been made, what they were and by who.

### Part A: 20 minutes

Spend time in groups discussing both of the following in relation to how you manage files.

- Data
- Documents

Sample discussion points:

- Where are they stored?
- How do we track changes to them?
- How do we manage multiple people working on them at once?
- How are they shared?
- How sensitive are the documents we're working on?

### Part B: 20 minutes

Key Points
----------

- We need a strategy for managing data and documentation
- Git and GitHub can solve day to day issues of data and document management.
