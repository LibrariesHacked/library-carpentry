======================================================

Requirements

- Boards/pads
- Pens
- Sticky notes

Task
----

To understand more about why Git and GitHub can be useful we're going to discuss how we all currently store documents and data.  Particularly where we require collaboration on those documents, and where seeing the changes that have been made.

Subjects:

- Data
- Documents

Questions:

- Where are they stored?
- How do we track changes to them?
- How do we manage multiple people working on them at once?
- How are they shared?
- How sensitive are the documents we're working on?

Key Points
----------

- Git and GitHub can solve day to day issues of data and document management.
