Task
----

To understand more about why GIS is important, we're going to discuss how GIS data is relevant to library data.

Taking a couple of activities that happen in a library, discuss in groups the locations and places that could be relevant to analysis of that activity.  As many as you can think of!

As an example, an Issue of an item could include the location of the library.

Activity:

- A library member checking out an item
- A new user joining the library

Each group will feedback and we'll discuss what data could be collected and how it could be analysed.
