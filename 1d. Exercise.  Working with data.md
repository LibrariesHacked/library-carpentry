1d. Exercise. Working with data
===============================

Requirements
------------

- Spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel, Libre Office)
- Internet

Task
----

We will be working with a couple of example datasets.  

- Issues Stats, released by Newcastle libraries, from 2008 to the present day.
- Member Stats, released by Newcastle libraries, from 2008 to the present day.

These would normally be downloaded from [the Data Mill North](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/ncclibs-loans) or [Toonlibraries GitHub](https://github.com/toonlibraries) account.

Work together and share knowledge to answer the following questions of the data.  During this time the trainers will see each group and help out/answer any questions.

## Question 1. Issues Data. Which library has the highest issues since 2008.  How many?


## Question 1. Issues Data. Which year has the highest number of issues?


## Question 3. Issues Data. Which month has the highest number of issues (across all years)?


## Question 4. Member Data. Which month has the highest number of new members?


## Question 5. Member Data.  Which postcode area has the highest number of members?

- Hint: Postcode area is the first letters of a postcode, e.g. NE.  The data provided here is postcode districts, e.g. NE3.  A postcode area could be 1 or two characters.


## Question 6.  Other Insight.  What else could be done with the data?


Key points
