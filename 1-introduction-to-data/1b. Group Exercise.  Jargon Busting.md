- Internet (optional)

Purpose

- Expectation management

Task
----

We will be separating into groups of 4-5 per table.

### Part A: 20 minutes

Taking the following set of terms and ideas, work together to explain what each one means (note: use both each other and the internet as a resource!).  Try to only spend 2-3 mins on each and don't worry about covering them all.  Make a note of those your group resolves and those you are still struggling with.

| Terms | Terms | Terms |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Dataset | Pivot | Data science |
| Group |  |  |
| Algorithm | Big data | Outlier |
| Open data | Aggregation | Anonymisation |
| Regular expression | Data mining | Data protection |

### B: Feedback

Report back on a term discussed by your group. 1 minute each.

We'll go through 'official' definitions of each.

Key points
----------

- It helps to share what you know and donâ€™t know about data and data-science jargon.
