Exercise.  Setting up a GitHub account
======================================

Requirements
------------

- Laptop/Tablet
- Internet

Task
----

In this task we'll ensure everyone (who wants to) sets up an account on GitHub.

If you don't want to set up an account on GitHub you can follow along with the lesson but avoid completing the signup process. We will also be creating an account that can be shared for use in the exercises.

- In a browser navigate to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com).

You'll see that GitHub is still very developer, and code focussed.  **'Built for Developers'** is the main Headline.  Don't let this put you off!  If you're a developer, or are even looking at getting started on code, and using GitHub for this, great.  If not, GitHub is still a good place to host documents and data, and having an account allows you to participate in wider project processes.

- In the top right hand corner click **'Sign Up'** or navigate straight to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
- Choose a username, email and password and select **'Create an account'**

The GitHub signup process is quite minimal. You only need to provide the minimum amount of details to create an account.

- On Step 2, leave the default option of **'Unlimited public repositories for free.'** and click **'Continue'**
- Feel free to complete Step 3, or click **'Skip this step'**
