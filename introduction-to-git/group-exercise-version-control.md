=================================================

Requirements
------------

- Boards/pads
- Pens
- Sticky notes

Task
----

To understand more about why Git and GitHub can be useful we're going to discuss how we all currently store documents and data.  Particularly where we require collaboration on those documents, including seeing when changes have been made, what they were and by who.

### Part A: 20 minutes

Spend time in groups discussing both of the different kind of files you have at your organisation:

- Data
- Documents

Here are some smaple talking points, though feel free to add any you feel appropriate.

- Where are they stored?
- How do we track changes to them?
- How do we manage multiple people working on them at once?
- How are they shared?
- How sensitive are the documents we're working on?
- What level of control do you have over what file platform you may use?

### Part B: 20 minutes

Key Points
----------

- We need a strategy for managing data and documentation
- Git and GitHub can solve day to day issues of data and document management.
