Task
----

We will be separating into groups of 4-5 per table.

### Part A: 20 minutes

Taking the following set of terms and ideas, work together to explain what each one means (note: use both each other and the internet as a resource!).  Try to only spend 2 mins (max) on each and don't worry about covering them all.  Make a note of those your group resolves and those you are still struggling with.

Use flipchart paper to write down each term, with thoughts on the definition around each one.

| Terms | Terms | Terms |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Dataset | Pivot table | Data science |
| Group | Formula | Average |
| Algorithm | Big data | Outlier |
| Open data | Aggregation | Anonymisation |
| Regular expression | Data mining | Data protection |

### B: Feedback 10 mins

Report back on a single term discussed by your group. 1 minute each.

We'll go through definitions of each.

Key points
----------

- It helps to share what you know and donâ€™t know about data and data-science jargon.
