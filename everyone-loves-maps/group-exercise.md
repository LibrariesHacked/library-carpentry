Requirements

- Flipchart paper

- Sticky notes

Task
----

To understand more about why GIS is important, we're going to discuss how location (and place) data is relevant to library data.

### Part A: 15 mins

Taking some activities that happen in a library, discuss in groups the locations and places that could be relevant to that activity.  As many as you can think of!

As an example, a physical loan of an item could include the location of the library from which it was loaned.  Start with the following activities but feel free to think up others.

- A library member checking out an item
- A new user joining the library

Use flipchart paper to note down the locations and places.

### Part B: Feedback 10 mins

Each group will feedback and we'll discuss the geographic data we could analyse in libraries.
