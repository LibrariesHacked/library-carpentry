Requirements

Task
----

To understand more about why GIS is important, we're going to discuss how location data is relevant to library data.

### Part A: 20 mins

Taking a couple of activities that happen in a library, discuss in groups the locations and places that could be relevant to analysis of that activity.  As many as you can think of!

As an example, a physical loan of an item could include the location of the library from which it was loaned.  Use the following two activities:

- A library member checking out an item
- A new user joining the library

### Part B: Feedback

Each group will feedback and we'll discuss the data we could analyse.
