Exercise.  Mapping libraries
============================

Requirements
------------

- Laptop or tablet
- Internet
- Data files (see downloads)

Downloads
---------

For this exercise we will be using two files.

- [Libraries taskforce libraries dataset](data/taskforce.csv).  A listing of English Libraries including their address and postcode.
- [UK postcodes](data/postcodes.csv]).  A full list of UK postcodes, taken from 'Code Point Open', an Ordnance Survey open data product.

Task
----

In this task we are going to take a dataset published by the Libraries Taskforce that includes the locations of all libraries in England.  We will load this into the online tool Carto (will will create an account).  We will then use the location of Postcodes, provided by Ordnance Survey, to **'geocode'** these libraries.  Finally, we'll plot them on a web map, and you'll have a chance to play around with how they're displayed.
