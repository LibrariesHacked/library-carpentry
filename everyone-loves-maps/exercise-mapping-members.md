Exercise.  Mapping Members
==========================

Requirements
------------

- Carto Account
- Laptop or tablet
- Internet

Data files
----------

We've used these files in 

- [Newcastle member data](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/library-carpentry/raw/master/data/newcastle_members_postcodeareas.csv).  As used in the previous data exercise, this is the Newcastle member data but 
- [Postcode areas](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/library-carpentry/raw/master/data/postcode_areas.geojson).  These are taken from OS Code Point Open and show the geometric polygons that represent postcode areas.  The polygons were created by Geolytix.

Task

In this exercise we are going to analyse library member locations, alongside some associated population statistics.
