Teaching. Introduction to GIS
=============================

GIS data
--------

### Points, lines and polygons

Typically when dealing with geo-spatial data, this will be in the form of Points, Lines, and Polygons.

| Data type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Points | Individual locations made up of a single coordinate set.  For example a library building would be a point. |
| Lines | Linear features made up of coordinates.  For example, a bus route may be expressed as a line where each point on that line is a bus stop. |
| Polygons | Bounded areas (shapes) made up of coordinates such as local authority boundaries and geofences. |
| Attributes | Associated with the above categories of data these may be names, or particular values e.g. 'Bath and North East Somerset' is the name of a polygon that represents a local authority boundary |

### File formats

#### Geographic coordinate systems

#### Spatial reference systems

### Geocoding and reverse geocoding


Demo: Geocoding a set of addresses

Demo: Reverse geocooding a set of addresses

### GIS Software

- Demo: adding a layer using QGIS.


### Web mapping - online tools

Our next couple of exercises will use Carto to load some GIS data and
