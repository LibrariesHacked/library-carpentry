Everyone Loves Maps

This is our third module, on mapping library data.

Introduction
------------

Everything happens somewhere. Appreciating geographic data is becoming increasingly important because there is so much we can learn from associated data about locations.  Examples include:

- deprivation statistics and need of areas which include: income, education, work, services;
- population density and rural/urban split;
- government and local government boundaries;
- the history of a place;
- associated languages in a place;
- natural environment such as flood plains, climate, and biodiversity.

Location vs. Place
------------------

What is the difference between location and place?  We tend to use 'Location' when talking about exact defined points or areas.  FOr example, a local government boundary, or the location of a library.  'Place' is normally more indefinable.  It may be 'the North', or 'abroad'.
