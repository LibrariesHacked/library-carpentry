Everyone Loves Maps
=================

This is our third module, on mapping library data.

Introduction
------------

Everything happens somewhere. Appreciating the data that is associated with geography is becoming increasingly important because there is so much we can learn from using data on geography.  Examples include:

- deprivation statistics and socioeconomic need of areas which include: income, education, work, services;
- population density and rural/urban split;
- government and local government boundaries;
- the history of a place;
- associated languages in a place;
- natural environment such as flood plains, climate, and biodiversity.
