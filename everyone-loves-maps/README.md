Everyone Loves Maps
===================

This is our third module, on mapping library data.

Introduction
------------

Everything happens somewhere. Geographic data is becoming increasingly important, because there is so much we can learn from data about locations.  Examples include:

- deprivation statistics and need of areas which include: income, education, work, services;
- population density and rural/urban split;
- number of young/old people;
- government, local government boundaries (and all sorts of other boundaries - you may be surprised!);
- the history of a place;
- associated languages in a place;
- natural environment such as flood plains, climate, and biodiversity.

Not only is geographic intelligence powerful and essential to data analysis, but it is fun! (Everyone loves maps...)


Location vs. Place
------------------

What is the difference between location and place?  We tend to use 'Location' when talking about exact defined points or areas.  For example, a local government boundary, or the location of a library.  'Place' is normally more indefinable.  It may be 'the North', or 'Abroad', or 'Home'.

Some examples

Geographic data is important for analysis but maps are also a great (and often beautiful) way of displaying data.  Much like with graphs though there are many pitfalls.  Let's have a quick look at a couple of maps being used to display the same information but in very different ways.
