Library Carpentry: Library Data
================================

This is a set of training materials for library staff on using data.  Although there are already excellent materials from the official Library Carpentry site, we are squeezing 3 workshops into one day so will be tailoring and modifying these as well as into these materials.

Library Carpentry (&copy; Library Carpentry) materials form the basis of these lessons, and are linked to throughout.  Library Carpentry builds on the work of Software Carpentry (Copyright &copy; Software Carpentry) and Data Carpentry.

Introduction
------------

Welcome to Library Carpentry! This series of introductory workshops on software skills for librarians started life as an exploratory programme funded by the Software Sustainability Institute and supported by Software Carpentry and City University London. 

The rationale for Library Carpentry is twofold. First, as Andromeda Yelton argues in her excellent ALA Library Technology Report ‘Coding for Librarians: learning by example’, code is a means for librarians to take control of practice and to empower themselves and their organisation to meet user needs in flexible ways. Second, librarians play a crucial role in cultivating world class research. And in most research areas today world class research relies on the use of software. Librarians with software skills are then well placed to continue that cultivation of world class research.

The original modules are designed to introduce software concepts to librarians.  This is acknowledging that software skills are of immense benefit for more people than just software developers.

Thanks go to the British Library and the University of Sussex where James Baker, who developed the workshops, worked when planning and delivering the workshops. The aim of Library Carpentry is to create a set of tools the community can manage, support, enrich, and reuse as it sees fit.

We are focussing on data skills for this day.  This brings in materials from the Library Carpentry workshop, 'Data Intro for Librarians'.  We are also using materials from the 'Git Intro for librarians' module.  Git is a tool primarily used by software developers to store, share, and manage code, but now increasingly used in a variety of applications, including for storing and using data.

The last module, written specifically for this course, is 'Everyone Loves Maps'.  This builds on a talk that was given at the Glass Box in Taunton, to the local developers Meetup group.  It has been adapated slightly, including practical exercises particularly with a public library data focus.

- **Data intro for librarians**. See [here for original lesson](https://data-lessons.github.io/library-data-intro/).  Less emphasis is placed on regular expression writing (though it is covered), and more on the data discussion exercise, and specific data tasks within a library context.
- **Git intro for librarians**. See [here for original lesson](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-git/).  Focus has been shifted to using the GitHub web interface (a cloud hosted version of Git), and using GitHub for hosting Open Data.  Also, using the features of tagging and licensing.
- **Everyone Loves Maps**. Not part of the Library Carpentry series, but a new set of materials aimed at introducing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) concepts and some practical exercises in creating online maps.  Adapted into a library context from [rough notes for a talk](https://github.com/DaveBathnes/GIS-Tutorial) given to the Taunton developer group.

Where to go for help
--------------------

First, identify people on your table who can help: you will all be working from the same material, so someone around you may have mastered the point you are stuck at.

Second, there are helpers on hand to help if those around you can’t. You should all have access to coloured sticky notes: attaching a red sticky note to your laptop indicates that you need help (it might also alert the attention of someone around you!). So, please use them.
Third, each part of Library Carpentry may require you to install software or download data. Breaks are a good time to ask for help.
Fourth, we encourage you to finish up or repeat tasks after class time: if you run into any problems, please report them on the relevant Github issues page (see the bottom of each lesson page for a link).

Most Library Carpentry lessons will require you to follow along whilst your instructor demonstrates a software tool or approach. Sometimes you will fall behind. If you do, raise your red sticky note and ask a helper if we can slow the pace. Your issue may be specific to your computer. Computers are stupid, can frustrate, and as you all have different machines it can be tricky to resolve problems. Please be patient, particularly if your issue is local. Stepping outside and taking a gulp of fresh air always helps.
