# Library Carpentry

This repository is a set of materials for running a library carpentry workshop.  Although there are already excellent materials available for this, we afre squeezing 3 workshops into one day so will be reducing slightly the amount covered in each.  Also

The original materials will be linked to, and do form the basis of these lessons.


## Single day workshop

Topics being covered are:
