Library Carpentry: Library Data
================================

This is a set of training materials for library staff on using data.  Although there are already excellent materials from the official Library Carpentry site, we are squeezing 3 workshops into one day so will be tailoring and modifying these as well as into these materials.

The original Library Carpentry (&copy; Software Carpentry) materials form the basis of these lessons, and are linked to throughout.  Library Carpentry builds on the work of Software Carpentry (Copyright &copy; Software Carpentry) and Data Carpentry.  It uses the same license as these projects, which is the [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Similarly, these additional materials are released under the same terms.

Single day workshop
-------------------

The original materials are designed to introduce software concepts (separated into modules) to librarians.  This is acknowledging that building software skills into librarianship is of immense benefit.

We are focussing on data skills for this day.  This brings in materials from the Library Carpentry workshop, 'Introduction to Data'.  We are also using materials from the 'Introduction to Git' module.  Git is a tool primarily used by software developers to store, share, and manage code, but increasingly used in a variety of applications, including for storing and using data.

The last module, written as part of the course is 'Everyone Loves Maps'.  This builds on a talk of the same name that was given at the Glass Box in Taunton to the local developers Meetup group.  It has been adapated slightly, including practical exercises, to focus on the use of geographic data, particularly with a public library focus.

- **Data intro for librarians**. See [here for original lesson](https://data-lessons.github.io/library-data-intro/).  Less emphasis is placed on regular expression writing (though it is covered), and more on the data discussion exercise, and specific data tasks within a library context.
- **Git intro for librarians**. See [here for original lesson](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-git/).  Focus has been shifted to using the GitHub web interface (a cloud hosted version of Git), and using GitHub for hosting Open Data.  Also, using the features of tagging and licensing.
- **Everyone Loves Maps**. Not part of the Library Carpentry series, but a new set of materials aimed at introducing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) concepts and some practical exercises in creating online maps.  Adapted into a library context from [rough notes for a talk](https://github.com/DaveBathnes/GIS-Tutorial) given to the Taunton developer group.
