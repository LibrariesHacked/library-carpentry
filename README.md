# Library Carpentry

This repository is a set of materials for running a library carpentry workshop.  Although there are already excellent materials available for this, we are squeezing 3 workshops into one day so will be reducing slightly the amount covered in each.

The original materials are helpfully separated into individual parts.

The original materials will be linked to, and form the basis of these lessons.

## Single day workshop

Topics being covered are:

- Data intro for librarians. 2hrs.  See [here for original lesson](https://data-lessons.github.io/library-data-intro/).  Less emphasis is placed on regular expression writing, and more on specific data taks within a library context.
- Git intro for librarians.  2hrs. See [here for original lesson](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-git/).  Focus has been shifted slightly to using the GitHub web interface (a cloud hosted version of Git), and using GitHub for hosting Open Data.  Also, using the features of tagging and licensing.
- Everyone Loves Maps. 2hrs.  Not part of the Library Carpentry series, but a new set of materials aimed at introducing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) concepts and some practical exercised in creating online maps.  Will be adapted into a library context from rough notes for an [Everyone Loves maps](https://github.com/DaveBathnes/GIS-Tutorial) talk given to the Taunton developer group.
